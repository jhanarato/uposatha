The code in this repository provides an API for calculating the moon days for the Buddhist 
lunar calendar. I have a very simple python script which for now simply outputs in text 
format the dates for the moon days of the rains retreat (vassa). The plan is to play around
a bit, refactor the code into a more useful class or set of classes to calculate the
moon days in the past and future. Eventually I might consider a Java port. Someone also
suggested JavaScript. A TODO for sure.
