I've already created the [uposatha-ical](https://github.com/jhanarato/uposatha-ical) package. You can use that now.

I've resurrected this old project, creating a new structure and a bunch of specifications you can read in the issues. Essentially the calendar model is generated from a configuration and requires no outside input.

Development follows a test driven process using pytest.
