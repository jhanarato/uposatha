Right now you can use the [uposatha-ical](https://github.com/jhanarato/uposatha-ical) package to read from the ical file ForestSangha.org uses. I'm adding tests and functionality to that project a the moment.

Once that's done I'll create a new version here that makes its own calculations and we can be done with the old ical file.
